# Risk Disclosure
At Alpha Funder, our commitment to transparency and risk awareness is paramount. Please carefully review the following information:

## Generic Nature of Content

Alpha Funders's content is intended to provide general information. It does not constitute a recommendation, endorsement, or sponsorship of any specific security, company, or fund.

Testimonials on our website may not represent the experiences of all clients or consumers.

Alpha Funder, its partners, representatives, agents, employees, and contractors disclaim all responsibility or liability for any use or misuse of such information.

## Futures and FX Trading

Futures and FX (foreign exchange) trading are not suitable for all investors. Investors may risk losing all or part of their initial investment. Trading should be conducted only with risk capital, which is money that can be lost without impacting one's financial stability or lifestyle. This communication is not a solicitation or offer to buy or sell futures, options, or forex. Past performance is not indicative of future results.

## CFTC Rule 4.41 - Hypothetical or Simulated Performance

Under CFTC Rule 4.41, hypothetical or simulated performance outcomes should be considered carefully. Simulated outcomes do not reflect actual trading results. Due to the absence of actual trading, simulated results may overcompensate or undercompensate for market conditions, including liquidity. Simulated trading programs are typically developed with the benefit of hindsight. No representation is made that any account will or is likely to achieve similar profits or losses.

## Risk Warning for Margin Trading CFDs

Margin trading contracts for difference (CFDs) carry a high level of risk and may not be suitable for all investors. Before trading CFDs, assess your trading objectives, experience, and risk tolerance carefully. It is possible to lose more than your initial investment, so only deposit funds you can afford to lose. Be aware of the risks and take appropriate precautions.
