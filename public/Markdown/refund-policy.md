# Refund Policy

**Refunds Post-Purchase**

Once a purchase has been made, the challenge credentials have been emailed to the customer, and the customer places their first demo trade (i.e. uses the fully-delivered product), no refunds will be issued under any circumstances, except as provided below. 

If you were directed to Alpha Funder through direct marketing, you are entitled to request a refund within 5 business days from the date of purchase. This right to a refund is voided if the client places a demo trade on any of their respective challenge accounts, thereby using the fully-delivered product. Please note you can opt-out of direct marketing by contacting us at support@alphafunder.io.

Refund requests must be submitted in writing to support@alphafunder.io. Refunds will be processed within 14 days of receiving the request, net of our variable costs associated with the product purchased by the customer, as determined by us.

**Refunds Upon Completion of the Alpha Challenge Program**

After successfully completing the Alpha Challenge and entering into a written agreement with us regarding the Alpha Funded Account, you will receive a refund of the initial challenge fee with your first successful profit split payment. Your challenge fee will not be refunded until you reach your first profit split.
